I created this project as a Desktop mood bot. the project includes an oled display(SSD1306), two IR sensors(TCRT5000), Two Dc motors with a motor driver(L298N), to control all the processes an ESP32 is used. when i wave hand from left to right the left ir triggers and the robot detects our mood as happy and the bot will take a 360 spin and it comes to the original position and displays a live supportive quote using perplexity API. Also when we swipe hand from right to leftt the robot detects tired and make two 1s forward motions and displays live supportive quote.
